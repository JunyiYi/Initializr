Steeltoe Initializr provides an extensible API to generate quickstart projects. It also
provides a configurable service. It provides a simple web UI to configure the project
to generate and endpoints that you can use via plain HTTP.

Steeltoe Initializr also exposes an endpoint that serves its metadata in a well-known
format to allow third-party clients to provide the necessary assistance.
